# SESSRS

Work in progress. Refactoring [this study](geoseg_train_graphs/graphs) to create a workflow for analyzing changes in satellite images. The workflow leverages the powerful Segment Anything modelâ€™s ability to create sharp masks over images, improving semantic segmentation and enabling accurate, class-specific masks of satellite images.
