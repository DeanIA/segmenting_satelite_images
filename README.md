# SESSRS

Work in progress. Refactoring this study to create a workflow for analyzing changes in satellite images. The workflow leverages the powerful Segment Anything model’s ability to create sharp masks over images, improving semantic segmentation and enabling accurate, class-specific masks of satellite images.

## To Do List

### ✅ Done
- Train semantic segmentation model
- Run Inference on Test Set
- Run Inference with SAM model

### ⬜ Not Done
- Run SESSRS comparison algorithm

---

### Next Step
- Feed YOLO bounding boxes into SAM for instance segmentation of buildings.
